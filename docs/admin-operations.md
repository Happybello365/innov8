# Admin operations

Reference for the protected `/admin` routes: how a request is authorised, how it
is traced end to end, and how clients should call it.

## Routes

| Method   | Path                              | Effect                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/admin/contract/mediators`       | Build an unsigned `add_mediator` XDR    |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/contract/mediators/:addr` | Build an unsigned `remove_mediator` XDR |
| `PATCH`  | `/admin/contract/fee`             | Build an unsigned `update_fee_bps` XDR  |
| `POST`   | `/admin/trades/batch/status`      | Batch trade status transitions          |
| `GET`    | `/admin/features`                 | List feature flags                      |
| `PATCH`  | `/admin/features/:name`           | Update a feature flag                   |
| `GET`    | `/admin/audit`                    | Paginated admin audit log               |
| `GET`    | `/api/admin/auth/claims`          | Echo the parsed JWT claims              |

Every route runs `authMiddleware` then `adminMiddleware`. An unauthenticated
call gets `401`; an authenticated wallet that is not in `ADMIN_STELLAR_PUBKEYS`
gets `403` with `{ "error": "Forbidden: admin access required" }`. The
allowlist is never echoed in the response.

The contract routes return an **unsigned XDR**. The backend never holds admin
keys — the caller signs and submits.

## Traceability

Every admin action carries two IDs, attached by `correlationIdMiddleware`:

| Header             | Meaning                                        | Caller-supplied? |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `x-correlation-id` | Logical trace spanning services; reused on hop | Yes, if valid    |
| `x-request-id`     | This HTTP request/response pair                | No, never        |

A caller-supplied correlation ID is accepted only if it is 1–128 characters of
`[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. Anything else is replaced with a generated UUID, so a malicious
value cannot be reflected into logs or response headers. The request ID is
always server-generated.

### How far the IDs travel

```
inbound request
  → correlationIdMiddleware       attaches req.correlationId / req.requestId
  → admin route handler           traceContextFrom(req) → TraceContext
  → ContractService.build*Tx      logged as admin_soroban_call
  → Soroban RPC                   simulate + prepare for the returned XDR
```

Route handlers call `traceContextFrom(req)` and pass the result as `trace` on
the service input. `ContractService` logs each admin contract call as
`admin_soroban_call` with `correlationId`, `requestId`, `contractFunction`,
`contractId` and the call arguments, so one admin action can be followed from
the HTTP access log through to the contract invocation it produced.

`TraceContext` fields are optional, so the same service methods stay callable
from jobs, scripts and tests that have no HTTP request behind them.

### Finding an action in the logs

Responses always echo both IDs as headers, including on `400` and `403`. Errors
that pass through `errorHandler` also carry them in the body:

```json
{
  "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
  "message": "...",
  "path": "/admin/contract/fee",
  "correlationId": "9f2c...",
  "requestId": "1a4e..."
}
```

Take either ID from the response and search the structured logs:

```bash
grep '"requestId":"1a4e..."' backend.log | jq .
```

## Event Idempotency Guarantees

Admin clawback operations emit ClawbackExecutedEvent on-chain. The backend event listener implements replay protection to handle duplicate or reordered events safely.

### Deduplication Strategy

The ProcessedEvent table tracks processed events using a composite unique key:

- ledgerSequence: Stellar ledger number
- contractId: Contract address
- eventId: Unique event identifier

When an event arrives, the listener checks if it has been processed before attempting to handle it. If a duplicate is detected, it is silently ignored.

### Event Schema Versioning

ClawbackExecutedEvent includes a schema_version field set to EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION. This allows the backend to detect structural changes in future contract upgrades and apply appropriate parsing logic.

### Atomic Processing

Event handling and deduplication markers are written in a single database transaction. This ensures that either both succeed or both fail, preventing scenarios where an event is marked as processed but its side effects were not applied.

### Reordering Tolerance

Events may arrive out of order due to network conditions or RPC cursor behavior. The listener processes events by ledger sequence and uses the ProcessedEvent table to skip any events that have already been handled, regardless of arrival order.

- Event listener implementation: backend/src/services/eventListener.service.ts
- Event handler logic: backend/src/services/eventHandlers.ts

That returns the request log line and the `admin_soroban_call` entry for the
same action. Use `correlationId` instead to follow a trace that spans more than
one service.

Validation failures rejected by `validateRequest` return `{ "error": "..." }`
without the IDs in the body; read them from the response headers instead.

## Calling admin routes from a client

Do not hand-roll `fetch` against `/admin`. Use the guarded helpers in
`frontend/src/lib/api/admin.ts`, which enforce the token, map failures to a
named reason, and forward the correlation ID.

```ts
import { adminApi, AdminApiError } from "@/lib/api/admin";

async function promoteMediator(token: string, mediatorAddress: string) {
  try {
    const { unsignedXdr } = await adminApi.contract.addMediator(
      token,
      { mediatorAddress },
      { correlationId: crypto.randomUUID() },
    );
    return await signAndSubmit(unsignedXdr);
  } catch (error) {
    if (!(error instanceof AdminApiError)) throw error;

    switch (error.reason) {
      case "unauthenticated":
        return redirectToLogin();
      case "forbidden":
        return showBanner("This wallet is not a configured admin.");
      case "validation":
        return showFieldError(error.message);
      case "rate_limited":
        return showBanner("Admin quota exceeded, try again shortly.");
      default:
        return showBanner(
          `Admin action failed (ref ${error.correlationId ?? "n/a"}).`,
        );
    }
  }
}
```

`AdminApiError.reason` is one of `unauthenticated`, `forbidden`, `validation`,
`not_found`, `conflict`, `rate_limited`, `server`, `network`, so UI code
branches on the failure mode rather than on raw status codes.

Two guarantees worth relying on:

- An empty or whitespace-only token throws `unauthenticated` **before** any
  network call, rather than sending an anonymous request.
- Identifiers interpolated into a path are URL-encoded.

For an endpoint not yet wrapped, use `adminRequest` directly rather than
`request` — it applies the same guard:

```ts
import { adminRequest } from "@/lib/api/admin";

const result = await adminRequest<MyResponse>("/admin/new-endpoint", token, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
```

## Tests

| File                                                            | Covers                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `backend/src/__tests__/admin.routes.validation.harness.test.ts` | Auth and validation failure modes         |
| `backend/src/__tests__/admin.correlationId.test.ts`             | ID generation and propagation to services |
| `frontend/src/lib/api/__tests__/admin.test.ts`                  | Token guard, endpoints, error mapping     |

The backend harness isolates each route behind mocked services, so a failure
points at the route's guards rather than at Prisma or Soroban RPC.

2. **[Admin Network Isolation Policy](file:///home/kaycee/Desktop/OS/innov8/docs/admin-network-isolation.md)**: Network topology, Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`, internal Ingress rules, and AWS Security Group policies.
3. **[Staging Smoke Testing Policy](file:///home/kaycee/Desktop/OS/innov8/docs/staging-smoke-testing.md)**: Automated staging deployment validation (`scripts/staging-admin-smoke-test.sh`), response assertions (401/403/200), and alert notifications.
4. **[CI Admin Regression Test Policy](file:///home/kaycee/Desktop/OS/innov8/docs/admin-ci-policy.md)**: CI gate enforcing mandatory unit/integration test coverage for PRs modifying admin endpoints.
