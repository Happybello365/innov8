## Feature

### Admin features

- `admin_clawback(trade_id, amount, destination)` — recovers escrowed funds (admin only)

### Contract changes

<!-- List on-chain changes: new/updated contract functions, emitted events,
state reads, invariants, and any migration notes. -->

- Event: `ClawbackExecutedEvent` (schema version, fields)
- View: `get_clawback_total(trade_id)`, `get_claimed_amount(trade_id)`
- Invariant: conservation of escrowed funds across partial clawbacks
